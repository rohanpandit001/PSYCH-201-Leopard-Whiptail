The animal we will be studying in this project is the Leopard Whipray (Himantura leoparda)





Article #1: Genetic and Physical Differences within the Himantura uarnak complex
Hypothesis: The hypothesis of this experiment is to determine which of the two species in the H. Leoparda family should continue to hold the name based on spotting patterns, and determine the nucleotide synapomorphies in the partial COI gene sequence that distinguish species within the H. uarnak species complex
Independent variables: 
Nucleotide sequences of the COI gene and cytochrome b (cytb) gene
Spotting patterns on the dorsal side of the individuals.
Nucleotide synapomorphies in the partial COI gene sequence.
Dependent variables:
The phylogenetic relationships among the species within the Himantura uarnak complex
The morphological differences are based on spotting patterns, which may help differentiate the species within the complex.
Identification of the species that should retain the name H. leoparda and a diagnostic description of the other species.

The results of the study indicate that the Leopard Whipray (Himantura leoparda) is genetically distinct from other species within the Himantura uarnak complex. The genetic differences, specifically in the COI gene, help to establish its evolutionary relationship with other species in the complex.
Additionally, the study found that the spotting patterns on the Leopard Whipray can be used to differentiate it from other species in the complex. Leopard Whiprays have more large ocellated spots (distinctive eye-like markings) compared to the species in Cluster 1, which have fewer medium-sized ocellated spots and more small interrupted spots.
A critique of the scientific article is the lack of randomization. The experimenters used a specific DNA sequence to characterize species boundaries and identify individuals to species, but they did not mention any randomization process in the study. The lack of randomization could lead to biased results as discussed in class. Another critique is related to external validity. The experimenters describe a new species based on the nucleotide sequence of the COI gene, which is considered a "universal barcode" in fishes. However, they acknowledge that an alternative mitochondrial marker in Elasmobranchs could be the NADH2 gene, but it is not yet possible to relate the five main NADH2 haplogroups observed in the H. uarnak species complex to the clusters identified in their study. This can mean that their findings may not apply to other mitochondrial markers, reducing the external validity of their research.
Considering the two cryptic species of the Leopard Whipray, Himantura leoparda, are genetically isolated and differ in spotting patterns, it is possible that these distinct patterns have evolved as a result of differences in habitat, predation, or mating preferences, thus contributing to the genetic isolation of the two species. To test this hypothesis, a comparative study of the ecological factors, such as habitat use, predator-prey interactions, and mating behavior, in the populations of both species (Cluster 1 and Cluster 4) could be conducted. This research could provide insights into the selective pressures responsible for the evolution of the different spotting patterns and their potential adaptive significance.

Article #2 Research Questions: Endangered Species-Studying their Behavioral Ecology To understand why they are becoming endangered

Hypothesis: The study aims to evaluate elasmobranch diversity, species composition, catch, and trade within the artisanal fisheries to address the critical knowledge gap in the Bay of Bengal of Bangladesh.
Control: The study does not mention a control group.
Independent variables: The independent variables include fishing pressure, habitat loss, climate change, and increasing value in trade, as well as inadequate information leading to limited conservation actions.
Dependent variables: The dependent variables are elasmobranch diversity, species composition, catch, and trade within the artisanal fisheries.
Critique:
a. Confounds: The study does not mention any specific confounding variables.
b. External validity: The study focuses on a specific region (the Bay of Bengal of Bangladesh), which may limit the generalizability of the findings to other areas.
c. Observer bias: Observer bias could be present as the researchers may have preconceived notions about the state of elasmobranchs in the region.
d. Randomization: The study does not mention any randomization in the selection of study sites or survey methods.
e. Experimenter effects: The study does not mention any measures taken to minimize experimenter effects.
f. Internal validity: While the study does provide comprehensive data on the elasmobranch diversity, species composition, catch, and trade within the artisanal fisheries in Bangladesh, there may be issues with internal validity due to potential biases or confounding variables not accounted for in the study.

Hypothesis building on top of the research:
a. Considering deviations: A hypothesis could be that certain elasmobranch species may exhibit unusual resilience to the high levels of fishing pressure and environmental changes in the Bay of Bengal of Bangladesh.

The study conducted in the Bay of Bengal recorded 95 rays from different species in Bangladeshi waters. The most common ray species observed were from the family Dasyatidae, which includes whiprays and stingrays. Specifically, the Leopard whipray (Himantura leoparda) contributed to approximately 11.12% (n = 560) of the total rays landed. Other whipray species like the Honeycomb whipray (Himantura undulata) and the Reticulate whipray (Himantura uarnak) contributed 9.67% (n = 487) and 8.97% (n = 452). The majority of the landed sharks and rays were juveniles, and the study provided insights into seasonality, distribution, gear used, and trade.


   Article #3: Microhabitat Selection by Marine Mesoconsumers in a Thermally Heterogeneous Habitat: Behavioral Thermoregulation or Avoiding Predation Risk?
 https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0061907

Summary: The researcher initially predicted that the rays would be found in the areas with the most food, but that is not what they found. They found that the rays liked shallow water with warmer water temperature. They believe that although this may come with “metabolic costs” due to higher temperatures, they thought that it would serve as a refuge after reviewing their data. However, the researcher questions whether rising water temperatures based on global warming will change the ray's habitat selection.

-Hypothesis: The hypothesis is that with the concern of climate change the predicted increase in water temperature may change the habitats of rays.
-Control: The controls are prey abundance and predator abundance.
-Independant: The independent variable is the water temperature.
-Dependent: The dependent variable that we are measuring is ray abundance and behavior.

Critique:
Confounds- 
First, Habitat selection decisions could’ve been influenced by abiotic factors such as sunlight or temperature. Also the study did not specify if competition played a role Second, A single coastal ecosystem limits the findings of other ecosystems because general findings are limited to one coastal ecosystem. Finally, The change in climate is not directly addressed on showing if a change in climate would impact the meso consumer population

External Validity-  Study was done in a coastal ecosystem with prey-predator population, thermal spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Other studies are needed for ecosystems with similar conditions in order to rule out external validity. 

Observer Bias - Observers collected data on rays however no distinct measures were used to minimize observer bias based on the method section

Randomization- influencing microhabitat selection, including water temperature, tidal height, prey abundance, predator abundance, and ray behavior data have been used in combination to study the behavior of rays. This combination is randomization. 

Experimental Effects- This study was more observation thus there were no experimental effects. It;s goal was seeing factors that have a direct influence on the population meso consumers in the microhabitat.

Internal Validity-
The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, Fisheries Western Australia permit, Department of Environment and Conservation permits organization made sure research done was conducted with legality and ethical code. The study used tidal height, both belt transects and water temperature, prey amount and behavior of rays. It also examined the habitat selection decisions of three marine mesoconsumers pink whiprays, reticulate whiprays, and  juvenile giant shovelnose rays a coastal ecosystem with intact predator, prey populations, marked spatial and temporal thermal heterogeneity. This provided  a list of factors that impact habitat selection and how they may vary across different species.

Generated Hypothesis 3: The hypothesis is there may be a change in the leopard ray species due to a combination of abiotic factors such as change in temperature, amount of sunlight, or salinity of water, 


  Article #4: An integrated risk assessment for climate change: analyzing the vulnerability of sharks and rays on Australia's Great Barrier Reef
 https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1365-2486.2009.02128.x

Summary: The article describes a risk assessment of global warming of sharks and rays in the great barrier reef of Australia. In the test, estuarine and reef associated sharks are the most vulnerable to climate change. The variables with the greatest impact are changes in temperature, freshwater input, and circulation.

-Hypothesis:  The hypothesis states that increased freshwater runoff into estuaries would reduce the presence of sharks and rays.
-Control: The controls are water temperature, predator, prey abundance, and ocean circulation.
-Independant:The freshwater runoff is our independent variable.
-Dependent: The dependent variable is shark and ray abundance.

Critique:
Confounds: 
Semi-quantitative nature: The assessment does not provide precise quantitative estimates of vulnerability. This limits the ability to compare vulnerability between different species or regions, or make pin point predictions about the impacts of climate change.

 Expert judgment: The subjectivity of expert judgment could introduce bias into the assessment. Using expert judgment, there may be bias included. 

Lack of consideration of other stressors: it does not explicitly consider other stressors such as overfishing, pollution, or habitat destruction. These stressors could interact with climate change to exacerbate vulnerability, and their exclusion could impact the accuracy of the assessment.

External Validity- the vulnerability of sharks and rays on Australia's Great Barrier Reef (GBR) to climate change, the external validity depends on how representative the GBR shark and ray species are of other shark and ray populations in other parts of the world. The assessment process and framework can serve as a foundation for similar assessments in other regions to identify at-risk species and their key biological and ecological attributes, critical habitats and ecological processes, and major knowledge gaps.

Observer Bias- doesn't involve direct observations of individuals or groups by observers.

Randomization- no randomization in terms of evaluating the assessment

Experimental Effects:  experimental effects during observing and analyzing due to the methods and data used in the assessment.  Semi-quantitative assessment of the vulnerability of sharks and rays on Australia's Great Barrier Reef to climate change, using a combination of traditional climate change vulnerability frameworks and fisheries ecological risk assessments.

Internal Validity- The article also presents findings and recommendations based on the assessment's results, including identifying at-risk species, key attributes, habitats, and processes, as well as potential strategies for mitigating climate change impacts. 

  Generated Hypothesis 4:  The hypothesis states that increased freshwater runoff into estuaries would reduce the presence of sharks and rays.

Article #5 https://www.proquest.com/docview/2525730081?pq-origsite=gscholar&fromopenview=true
-Hypothesis: The hypothesis of this article is that using environmental DNA (eDNA) sampling and molecular biology methods can provide a comprehensive and up-to-date evaluation of the biodiversity of Class Chondrichthyes (sharks and rays) in the Banggai Archipelago

-Control: Researchers did not have another sample of eDNA to compare to thus there was only one 1 eDNA being studied thus there was not control group

-Independant: There is no independent variable 

-Dependent: the dependent variable is the biodiversity of Class Chondrichthyes (sharks and rays) in the Banggai Marine Protected Area (MPA) in Indonesia.

Critique:
Confounds- The efficiency of eDNA may be high however the accuracy may be low as there is a very wide range of species to cover. Some factors that may affect accuracy are quality samples of water, and seasonal changes that affect the water. 

External Validity- External validity is limited to the specific samples of the sharks and rays class of organisms thus there is no external validity. 

Observer Bias- The study used molecular biology methods to analyze the biodiversity of sharks and rays. There may be observer bias after the results of the research methods have been conducted however none was directly shown. 

Randomization- There was no information on how the samplings were taken from the Baggain Islands thus determining randomization is difficult. 

Experimental Effects- researchers did not manipulate any variables or treatments. The study was just a survey of biodiversity using eDNA. The environment was just used for identifying rays and sharks in Baggain Islands. 

Internal Validity-Using molecular biology to analyze the biodiversity of the Chondrichthyes in four areas of the Islands of Baggai suggests that the study was made to decrease confounding and internal validity.  

Generated  Hypothesis 5:  using environmental DNA (eDNA) sampling and molecular biology methods can provide a comprehensive and up-to-date evaluation of the biodiversity of Class Chondrichthyes in the Banggai Archipelago however pollution may disrupt the accuracy  of the evaluation thus a alternative and catch and release method.

Background information: 
The Leopard Whipray (Himantura leoparda) is a unique species of stingray belonging to the family Dasyatidae. It is primarily found in the shallow coastal waters and estuaries of the Indo-Pacific region, extending from the Indian Ocean to the western Pacific Ocean, including countries like India, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, and the Philippines. 

Physical Characteristics: The Leopard Whipray is characterized by its distinctively large, diamond-shaped pectoral disc, which can reach up to 5.6 feet (1.7 meters) in width. Its body is dorsoventrally flattened, which is typical of stingrays, and it has a long, whip-like tail that can extend up to three times the length of its disc. The tail is equipped with one or more serrated, venomous stingers used for self-defense.

 Coloration and Pattern: The dorsal side of the Leopard Whipray is covered with a striking leopard-like pattern of dark spots and blotches on a light brown or olive-green background, which serves as an effective camouflage against predators and helps the ray blend into the sandy or muddy seafloor. The ventral side is predominantly white, providing countershading for protection from predators. 

Habitat and Diet: Leopard Whiprays are benthic animals, meaning they inhabit the bottom of the ocean floor. They are typically found in shallow coastal waters, including estuaries, mangroves, and sandy or muddy flats. They feed on a variety of prey, including small fish, crustaceans, and mollusks, which they locate using their electroreceptive organs called ampullae of Lorenzini. 

Reproduction and Conservation Status: Leopard Whiprays are ovoviviparous, which means that the embryos develop inside eggs that remain within the mother's body until they are ready to hatch. The female gives birth to live young, called pups, in litters of up to seven individuals. Their conservation status is currently listed as "Vulnerable" on the IUCN Red List, primarily due to habitat degradation, overfishing, and the use of destructive fishing practices. 

Fun Fact: One of the fascinating aspects of the Leopard Whipray is its ability to "walk" along the seafloor. It uses its highly flexible pectoral fins to propel itself forward in a unique walking motion, which allows it to navigate through its complex and shallow habitats more efficiently than swimming. This fascinating adaptation also helps the ray conserve energy and search for food more effectively.

Data Collection: To Collect the necessary video data of the Leopard Whipray, we visited the New England Aquarium and different days and at times. Due to how endangered these animals are, and their docile nature, collecting video evidence posed quite a difficulty for our group. We were only able to see the Himantura Leoparda once a week as that is when they were shown. Most of the animal’s anatomy is on the bottom of their bodies, however, they tend to “walk” on the ocean floor and even after spending weeks and several hours a day trying to document their full body, it was near impossible.

Research design:
A hypothesis could be that certain elasmobranch species may display unusual determination to the high levels of fishing pressure and environmental changes in the Bay of Bengal of Bangladesh.
Sampling design: The first step would be to design a sampling strategy to collect data on elasmobranch diversity, species composition, catch, and trade within the artisanal fisheries in the Bay of Bengal of Bangladesh. This could involve selecting specific fishing locations or ports, and determining the sample size and frequency of data collection.
Data collection: Once the sampling design is established, data can be collected through a combination of methods, such as onboard observer programs, market surveys, interviews with fishers, and DNA barcoding of species samples.
Data analysis: The collected data can be analyzed to determine the diversity, species composition, catch, and trade of elasmobranchs in the artisanal fisheries of the Bay of Bengal of Bangladesh. Statistical analyses such as species accumulation curves, diversity indices, and multivariate analyses can be used to assess the variation in species diversity and composition across different fishing locations or seasons.
Interpretation and communication of results: The final step would involve interpreting the results of the data analysis and communicating the findings to stakeholders such as fishers, fishery managers, and policymakers. The results could inform the development of management plans and conservation strategies for elasmobranchs in the Bay of Bengal of Bangladesh, and help to address the critical knowledge gap in this region.

In article one “Genetic and Physical Differences within the Himantura uarnak complex”, the author talks about the Leopard Whipray, Himantura Leoparda  contains two different genetically isolated species which are labeled as ‘Cluster 1’ and ‘Cluster 4’. They continue to write about how you tell the difference by the spotting patterns on the dorsal surface of adults and how they found the differences originally. They also add some facts about where they are located and how that can help with their difference in patterns. One of the critique of the article is the lack of randomization. When conducting this experiment the experimenters used a specific DNA sequence to identify and characterize the species boundaries. Without randomization, the experiment could fall into a biased category making the research from the experiment not as strong and problematic free as it could be. Moving to the articles hypothesis which was to find out which of the two species in the Himantura Leoparda should keep the name based on the spotting patterns and the determine the nucleotide synapomorphies in the partial COI gene sequence that distinguish species within the H. uarnak species complex.

In article two “Research Questions: Endangered Species-Studying their Behavioral Ecology To understand why they are becoming endangered”, the author talks about the low level of resistance to increased fishing pressure, which is compounded by habitat loss, climate change, rising trade value, and a lack of information, which results in little conservation efforts. Majority of the artisanal fisheries in the Bay of Bengal if not all contribute to a very high level of global fishing pressure on elasmobranchs which are a category of a type of fish usually referring to the sharks, rays, and skates. They conducted an experiment recording 95 rays all from different species in Bangladeshi. Most of the landed sharks and rays were younger or considered juveniles as they looked for more insight on distribution, gear used, seasonality, and trade. A critique was that the experiment did not mention a lot when it came to specific confounding variables, randomization of any sorts, any mention of measures to minimize any experimenter effects, along with also possibly having observer bias because the researchers may have preconceived notions about the state of elasmobranchs in the region. When it comes to the hypothesis which is that the study intends to fill a crucial knowledge vacuum in Bangladesh's Bay of Bengal region by evaluating elasmobranch diversity, species composition, capture, and trade within artisanal fisheries.

In article three “Microhabitat Selection by Marine Mesoconsumers in a Thermally Heterogeneous Habitat: Behavioral Thermoregulation or Avoiding Predation Risk?”, the author talks about how habitat selection decisions by consumers have the potential to actually shape the ecosystems and how understanding the factors that influence the habitat selection can actually help us better understand the ecosystem and how it functions. After watching the factors that affect microhabitat selection of marine meso consumers which for this experiment was juvenile giant shovelnose rays (Glaucostegus typus), reticulate whiprays (Himantura uarnak), and pink whiprays (H. fai) in more of a coastal view of the ecosystem with predators and prey populations.They used belt transects and data on a multitude of things such as water temperature, prey and predator abundance, ray behavior, and tidal height to find that giant shovelnose rays and reticulate whiprays were found more often resting that had low tidal heights during warm season sure as nearshore microhabitats. A critique that this experiment had and was probably one of the biggest was that the habitat selection could have easily been influenced by factors such as sunlight or even temperature. Another was that they only worked in one specific coastal ecosystem which means their research was only limited to that area. They also did not specifically address the change in climate possibly having an impact on the meso consumer population. Lastly, the hypothesis is that with the concern of climate change the predicted increase in water temperature may change the habitats of the rays.

In article four, “An integrated risk assessment for climate change: analyzing the vulnerability of sharks and rays on Australia's Great Barrier Reef”, the author talks about the Integrated Risk Assessment for Climate Change (IRACC) and how it was created and put to access the vulnerability of sharks and rays on Australia’s Great Barrier Reef (GBR) to climate change. This assessment tells us that for the GBR, reef associated rays and sharks and freshwater are the most vulnerable to climate change. It also shows that the vulnerability is directed by case-specific interactions. Some of the critiques were that it did not show an exact quantitative estimate of vulnerability as it was described in the text as semi-quantitative. Another one was the lack of consideration for the other things that could also be considered stressors for climate change. Lastly this experiment not only just focuses on sharks and rays but also it only relies on expert judgment to evaluate the vulnerability which leaves a lot of room for bias and research from only one side.

In article five, “Sharks and rays (Chondrichthyes) around Banggai Island, Banggai MPA, Indonesia: biodiversity data from an environmental DNA pilot study”, the author talks about the island group, the Banggai Archipelago. They begin to talk about how the larger provincial level Banggai MPA was formally established under national law in 2019 after two district level marine protected areas were rendered inoperable by the autonomy act. For this to continue comprehensive and current biodiversity data are required but the finance and knowledge about taxonomies are very scarce. The biodiversity of the sharks and rays were assessed using molecular biology techniques by seawater samples (exactly 3 replicates per site) from the Bionesia in Bali. Some of the critiques of the experiment were information on the sampling locations' selection procedures, including whether randomization was employed, but were not detailed in the section on randomization-methods. Another one was the effectiveness of detecting species with eDNA may vary depending on variables like water flow and sample storage. It may also miss some species and it is therefore probable that certain elasmobranch species found in the Banggai MPA were missed by this investigation. The study only collected samples at one point in time, thus it's possible that it missed seasonal or temporal variations in biodiversity. This study aims to test the hypothesis that molecular biology techniques and environmental DNA (eDNA) sampling can offer a thorough and current assessment of the biodiversity of Class Chondrichthyes (sharks and rays) in the Banggai Archipelago.

The paragraph on the ethics
When it comes to ethics, this might be the most important part of your experiment because this can give you the green light to continue and actually begin your project or the red light which will stop any progress. The three players that could possibly be affected are the players aka the rays, the water in which we are taking samples from, and our team as researchers. One of the biggest ethical guidelines is to always have minimal risk when it comes to any of the players. Minimal risk is any harm or discomfort that study participants may endure is not more severe than what they may encounter in their regular lives or during standard physical or psychological examinations. This also goes into making sure that the risk is absolutely the very lowest level of risk that could possibly happen while also going again with your study. To start with the key players, the rays, we are not physically hurting them but we will gently mark and tag to keep track of them, therefore we could possibly be messing up their routine which might cause psychological problems as messing with a routine can cause instability. We will be getting our research through a multitude of things such as onboard observer programs, market survey, interviews with fishers in the area, and DNA barcoding of species samples. We plan to ask the fisherman at the specific port questions like what level of fishing pressure is there in the Bay of bengals and are there any cultural or economic factors that may influence the fishing pressure on elasmobranch populations in the Bay of Bengal? Observing is one of the safer ways to research without breaking ethical guidelines and that is one of the reasons why we will do it. After the observing and surveys/interviews, statistical techniques can be used to assess variations in species diversity and composition across different fishing grounds or seasons which will better reflect the truth.
